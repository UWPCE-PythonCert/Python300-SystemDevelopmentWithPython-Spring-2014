A couple matplotlib tutorials.

Both are primarily iPyhton notebooks.

To view / run them, navigate to the folder they are in::

  $ cd matplotlib/Tutorial1
  $ ipython notebook

And your browser should be brought up with a index tp the notebooks in a main window.


The first one is nice, but short and sweet.

The second one is longer, and really gets into the internals of MPL -- so a really good idea if you want to do more than basic plotting.

Thanks to the authors of these -- acknowledged in the doocs themselves.
