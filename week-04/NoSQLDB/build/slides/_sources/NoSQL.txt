Usually a way to persist and recover that organised data.

These days, when you say "Database" almost everyone thinks "Relational Database", and SQL is the standard way to do that.

SQL RDBMS systems are robust, powerful, scalable and very well optimised.

But: They require you to adapt the relational data model. 

Non RDBMS options:
==================

A key buzzword these days is "NOSQL"

OK: They don't use SQL -- but what are they?

Not one thing, but key features are mostly shared:
